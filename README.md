This system is developed using the PHP language framework Laravel (8.83.6). The MySql DB engine is used for data storage. 

## Technical solutions
- MVC laravel principles. System use Model Objects to manipulate data in data layer, Controller objects are used to make logical operations with requests, Views responsible for front-end part.

- One To Many Relationships: Model Project has many -> Group models, Group model -> has many Student models. This solution allows to get all groups that belong to a project as well as get all students that belong to certain groups.

- System use arrilot / laravel-widgets package to update data in status page every 10 seconds.
- For RESTful api system use common laravel resource object
- Automated tests are made with PHPunit
- Front-end is made using bootstrap framework.
